# GAN Experiments

#### Note: this is just basic exploratory work at the moment

This contains the jupyter notebook file and data to run the CTGAN implementation.
The notebook 'CTGAN_Data_1991CensusSARS-V2.ipynb') contains some basic data analysis and a few runs of CTGAN to explore what it can do

Data is from the Census 1991 Individual SARs data
Study Number 7210 - Census 1991: Individual Sample of Anonymised Records for Great Britain (SARs)

The file 'manchester_subset.csv' contains a subset of data for just the Manchester area. This was prepared using the included R file 'data_prep_CensusSARS1991-uploaded.R' - it is included for completeness and not required
