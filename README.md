# GAN Experiments

#### Note: this is just basic exploratory work at the moment

This contains a jupyter notebook file to explore running the CTGAN implementation.
The notebook ('CTGAN_Data_1991CensusSARS-V2.ipynb') contains some basic data analysis and a few runs of CTGAN to explore what it can do

##### Data is from the Census 1991 Individual SARs data
Study Number 7210 - Census 1991: Individual Sample of Anonymised Records for Great Britain (SARs).

The dataset 'manchester_subset.csv' used for the experiments contains a subset of data for just the Manchester area. This was prepared using the included R file 'data_prep_CensusSARS1991-uploaded.R' from the original data. 

#### NOTE: The dataset is not in this repository, I will email it as I am not sure if it is allowed to be shared publicly
